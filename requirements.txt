# --- Core Data Science & Bioinformatics ---
numpy==1.26.4          # CRITICAL: Pinned to avoid compatibility issues with other libraries.
pandas                 # For data manipulation and creating results tables.
biopython              # For parsing, cleaning, and manipulating FASTA sequence files.

# --- Cheminformatics & Ligand Handling ---
rdkit-pypi             # Core library for handling SMILES strings and generating 3D ligand structures.
pubchempy              # Used for the programmatic retrieval of ligand data from the PubChem API.

# --- Plotting & Visualization ---
matplotlib             # Primary library for creating static plots, including the final heatmap.
seaborn                # Used for creating high-quality, aesthetically pleasing visualizations like the heatmap.
plotly                 # For interactive plotting capabilities.

# --- AI & Deep Learning (for the original Progen2 model) ---
# Note: These are required if you run the initial AI sequence generation part of the project.
torch                  # The backend deep learning framework for transformers.
transformers==4.30.2   # Hugging Face library to run the Progen2 model. Pinned for reproducibility.
tokenizers             # A dependency for the transformers library.

# --- Utilities ---
openpyxl               # A dependency for pandas to handle .xlsx files if needed.
